# Calculator
Quick calculator program with a GUI

The calculator is capable of addiiton, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponent, and roots. However, capability for decimal roots and powers hasn't been completley added. Currently when a decimal power or root is inputted (such as 3^0.5), the answer isn't exact and is rounded down. 

Calculator_gui is the same calcultor as python_calculator but with an added GUI.
